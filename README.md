# BISTED-HEALTHCARE-WORKFORCE-MENTAL-HEALTH-ANALYSIS-FOR-2022
ntroduction

The mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce are critical components of an effective healthcare system. Healthcare professionals are frequently exposed to high-pressure environments, long working hours, emotionally demanding situations, and occupational stress, which can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, burnout, and stress-related disorders. These challenges not only affect the personal well-being of healthcare workers but also impact patient care, job performance, and staff retention.

Monitoring and understanding the mental health status of healthcare workers is essential to developing strategies that support their well-being. By analyzing mental health data, healthcare organizations and policymakers can identify risk factors, implement targeted interventions, and foster a supportive work environment that promotes resilience, job satisfaction, and overall mental health.

Dataset Insights for the Case Study

✔ Burnout & Stress by Job Role:

● Employees in ICU, General Medicine, and Radiology report the highest stress levels.

● Heavy Workload is the leading stress factor for clinical roles, while Career Stagnation is a major issue for administrators.

✔ Burnout’s Impact on Job Satisfaction & Turnover:

● Employees experiencing burnout often report low job satisfaction (scores ≤ 2).

● 43% of employees show high burnout, with turnover rates significantly higher among this group.

✔ Mental Health Absences & EAP Access:

● Employees without access to EAPs take more mental health-related absences.

● The correlation suggests that providing EAPs could help mitigate workforce burnout.

✔ Turnover Intention Predictors:

● Employees with stress levels of 7–10 and job satisfaction ≤ 2 are at highest risk of leaving.

● Turnover risks are most significant in General Medicine and ICU departments.
